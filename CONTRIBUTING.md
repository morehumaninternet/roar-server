# Contributing

Roar was built with love by a group of digital activists from different backgrounds and levels of experience.
We appreciate you for wanting to help. There are plenty of [issues](https://github.com/morehumaninternet/roar-server/issues) and anyone can contribute.

If you want to help by resolving an issue, we encourage you to look at the list of ["good first issue" issues](https://github.com/morehumaninternet/roar-server/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). These issues will help you get your feet wet and get familiar with our codebase.

If you want to open a bug, please open a new issue with the following details:

- A short description of the bug. e.g. "Can't upload an image".
- Details about your setup - extension version, server version, chrome version etc.
- What actually happens. e.g. "When uploading a new PNG image, the extension crash".
- What you expect to happen. e.g. "When uploading a new PNG image, the extension should display the new image".
- Steps to reproduce the bug.
  Screenshots and short videos can help us identify and solve the bug and they'll be greatly appreciated.
